   I personally had much trouble with getting the CSIS server to work (Yes after doing the permisions). For whatever reason the site just times out sometimes and during these down phases I couldn't even manage to connect with NppFTP. Thankfully it eventually decided to start working and I was able to finish the assignment, however it would be my least tasteful selection of the three hosting choices. I haven't had any issues with the m-drive/v-drive, but I would argue that 000webhost is the better hosting selection. 000webhost's built in file manager is quite nifty and makes building your site quite simple, even if you don't go for their already prebuilt site builder portion. On top of its relative ease to use, I never had any issues attempting to upload files, change them, or whatever I needed. The site was never down unlike the CSIS server. Therefore I'd say 000Webhost would be the one I would use for keeping info about articles or for building a site.
